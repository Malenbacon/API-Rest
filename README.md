# Api Restfull
- Creating an Api for training that have GET , POST , PUT and DELETE

##How can you can you run it?
- You need to download the project, create a .env, put your database connection link and execute these commands in the project folder:
```javascript
npm i
npm start
```
- Use a program to simulate http requests. I recommend postman or insomnia
